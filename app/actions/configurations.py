"""
Define here the data needed for each action that can be performed against the third-party system.

For example, to authenticate and test the connection you may need an endpoint, a username and a password
class AuthenticateConfig(ActionConfiguration):
    endpoint: str
    username: str
    password: str

And to extract movement data you may need a different endpoint
class PullObservationsConfig(ActionConfiguration):
    endpoint: str
    
Any extra fields can be added ad needed too.
